# Foodborne_Illness
A project investigating foodborne illness data collected from the CDC in the United States.  This project is focused on EDA and data storytelling regarding real world foodborne illness outbreaks, and how someone working in the public health field may use the insights found.  

The data used can be found in the .csv file "NationalOutbreak_OutbreakData.csv" which incldudes data regarding 46,024 instances of foodborne illness in the United States and consists of features such as the year of the outbreak, the number of illnesses due to the outbreak, and other information.  

In this project, I first explore the data and use it to tell a story aimed at a non-technical audience. Next I incorporate two other data sets, one from the US Census regarding state population densities, and another quantifying per person healthcare spending, to examine which states are most effectively using their public health funds to prevent foodborne illnesses.  

Census data can be found at https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/density-data-text.html and is stored in the file census_data.csv.
Per person Healthcare spending data can be found https://www.commonwealthfund.org/datacenter/public-health-funding and is stored in public-health-funding.csv.

More information and the primary data set can be found here: https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/BEAM-FAQ.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnors%2Fdata%2Fdashboard%2Ffaq-using-dashboard.html
